Note: the every following step is the independent step. You can run any step you want.

1.Word Segmentation
 >Import the eclipse, and open the test.java. 
 >Change the paramter of the FileReader to the name of which text you want to do word segmentation. 
 >Change the paramter of the FileWrite to the file name you want to output. 
 >Run 

2.Get Feature
 >Change all the Input and Output file name which is you want to run
 >Change how many features you want get by the NumOfFeature
 >Run message.py

3.Get the Result
 >Change all the Input and Output file name which is you want to run 
 >Run deal.py

What is the result of the Running?

>Word Segmentation
	It get a file which is divided by word segmentation with keeping the original file form.
